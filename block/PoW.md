# Power of Work
Itâ€™s an arithmetic proof of combining Keccak family hash functions with MQ problems, which is capable of resistance to AISC and more GPU-friendly.

### How does the PoW of AEGIS work?

1. The first byte of the nbit field of the block header determines the number of MQ equation sets and variables (equation = nbit[0], variables = nbit[0] + 5), and the second byte determines the threshold value (threshold = nbit[1]).
2. The coefficients of the MQ equation set are generated by using all the raw data except the block header nonce as input to shake256XoF.
3. Bring nonce into the set of MQ equations generated in step 2, and get the crediting right of the new block if the following 2 conditions are met.
   - Nonce is the solution to the system of equations generated in step 2.
   - MQHASH(shake256XoF(nonce)).bits(0, 9) > threshold
